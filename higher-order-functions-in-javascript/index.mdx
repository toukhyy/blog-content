Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. They are a powerful feature in JavaScript, allowing for more flexible and expressive code.

```javascript
// Higher-order function example: map
function map(array, transform) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    result.push(transform(array[i]));
  }
  return result;
}

// Function to be passed as an argument to map
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}

// Usage
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var doubledNumbers = map(numbers, double);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In the code sample above, we have a higher-order function called `map` that takes an array and a `transform` function. It iterates over each element in the array and applies the `transform` function to it, building a new array with the transformed values.

We define the `double` function, which simply doubles a given number. We then pass `double` as an argument to `map` along with an array of numbers. The `map` function applies the `double` function to each element in the array, resulting in a new array where each number is doubled.

Higher-order functions like `map` provide a concise and reusable way to perform common operations on arrays, such as filtering, transforming, or reducing their elements. They promote code modularity and can significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code.

I hope you find these blog posts informative and helpful in understanding inheritance and higher-order functions in JavaScript!
